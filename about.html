            Hi! My name is Xavier Perez and I just thought making a website about cats to show off was a good idea!
            So, here we are. This website will be updated as time passes and the more I learn of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so that one day, this website can be in actual use in Google.
            Other than that, I'm currently a senior year student at PCTI, and only a few people are gonna see this website
            because only those with the link can get it right now (hi ally and ashy and whoever else). so yea. this page prob will get deleted too in final production, so enjoy it now!
